# ScoreKeeper

The first screen:
This is an Android application which can be used to keep the score for 2 players or 2 teams
It can be used for any game with 2 gamers.
The name of the games is chosen by the user and the names of every players/teams too.
The last button selected will give the names. If you put names on both of Playes editTexts and Team editTexts,
only names from the one selected will apear in the second screen.
If you don't write anything, in the second screen will apear by default FOOTBALL, Player 1 and Player 2.

The second screen:
The buttons +1 Point, +2 Points gives to the points to the player.
The buttons Bonus add 3 points to the player. It is decided by the arbiter. 
Firsly, I had to make just the part of the keeping score, but I have thought 
that it's better to do something more generally and which can help me and my friends
keeping the score when we are playing different games.
The button END GAME show the result from a moment which can be equality or someone won.
The button RESET SCORE reduces the point obtained by then to zero.
The button START A NEW GAME sends the user to the first screen to start again the game.
